### _Let's get to real business_

Hello there, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm **Muiz Haruna**, known as devdesiignn, aspiring to elevate my skills as a Front-end developer to ultimately become a proficient engineer.

Combining my experience in design with my passion for frontend development, I've ventured into the realm of technical writing to share insights and discoveries from my journey in this dynamic field.

My background in design not only fuels my creativity but also enhances my ability to convey technical topics in an accessible manner. Additionally, my proficiency in utilizing no-code/low-code tools such as WordPress and Framer enables me to bridge the gap between design and development, empowering me to translate intricate ideas into functional prototypes swiftly and efficiently.

Through my writing, I aim to inspire fellow enthusiasts while demystifying the intricacies of frontend development, fostering a deeper understanding within the tech community.
