# Hello There! Or shall I say "__greetings__"?

My name is Muiz Haruna, a Nigerian who builds beautiful yet functional user interfaces, and I know a couple of ways to get the job done.

I am currently learning all I need to know so as to be an established frontend developer or software engineer.

The road is long, but it's worth it as I am REALLY interested in building great stuff and will go into smart agriculture (agriculture + tech) after making lots of money. ðŸ˜…

I'm interested in robotics as a field and will go into that later when it is right, but currently I don't even know how to solder. LOL.

I love **booksâ€”print versions**, hardcover software engineering books, self-development books, and mostly **SWAGSSS**.

I write articles on [Medium](https://medium.com/@devdesiignn) and [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/@devdesiignn); you can check them out later.

You can reach out to me for work via [Email](mailto:hmuiyze@gmail.com).

I know HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, ReactJS, TailwindCSS, Wordpress, Webflow, and Framer, plus I have a background in interface design.

Bye for now; see you around.
